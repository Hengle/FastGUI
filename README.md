Unity 3D Tool for parsing PSD into NGUI


This is a tool I've created and supporter for over 2 years, but after a flood of copy of my source code and releasing as a different product on asset store, I decide to release it as an open free project.
Is a bit outdated, but the parser from Photoshopstill realy good, and all the algoritims are there as well, so feel free to do what you need with it

Old videos about the tool:
